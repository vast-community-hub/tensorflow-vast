	" This assumes self represents a Matrix (is a collection of collection of numbers)
	 To make our softmax function numerically stable, we simply normalize the values in the vector, 
	 by multiplying the numerator and denominator with a constant C. We can choose an arbitrary 
	 value for log(C) term, but generally log(C)=-max(a) is chosen, as it shifts all of elements in the 
	 vector to negative to zero, and negatives with large exponents saturate to zero rather than 
	 the infinity, avoiding overflowing - (Taken from PolyMath)"
